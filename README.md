# Garbage-Classification
Hello fellow learners, 

The objective of this project is to build a model to classify garbage using images.

I used a dataset from kaggle --> Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification

##TABLE OF CONTENT
1. Data preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model Training
4. Inference

#Data Preprocessing
* Removed corrupted images
* Resized images to 224Ã—224
* Converted all images to RGB
* Performed Train/Val/Test split (70/15/15)

# EDA Highlights
* Visualized class distributions
* Showed random image samples
* Checked dataset balance

# Training Instructions
* Install dependencies
  install -r requirements.txt
